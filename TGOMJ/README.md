THE GAME OF MAH JONG ver 3.0a
=============================

Welcome to The Game of Mah Jong! This is a 3D computer simulation of 
classic four-player Mah Jong, for one human player and three computer-
controlled "robot" players. The logic used by the robot participants 
in this computer simulation was inspired by the author's personal 
playing style. There are many variants of Mah Jong, and this computer 
simulation follows the rules as defined by the Japan Mah Jong 
Association. It also has the flexibility to allow you to define your 
own scoring points and house hands. The game includes help 
documentation.
